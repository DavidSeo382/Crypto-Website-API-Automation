# Crypto Website API Pull Automation 

## Overview
This project was created for my future self when I plan on getting into cryptocurrency. Much of the jargon of crypto I do not understand, however, I wanted to create a Python script that appended the data of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. This data would then be appended into a CSV file rather than a pandas dataframe because I wanted the data to be an accumulation of multiple days and to avoid any issues if there was a crash. The data would then be read into Jupyter Notebooks where I can reformat the data for future analysis. I also Utilized CoinMarketCap's API in order to acquire the data. 

Note: I plan on running this script for the next few weeks to build up as much data as I can
