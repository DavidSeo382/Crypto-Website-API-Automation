# Crypto Website API Automation 

## Overview
Created a Python script that appended the data of the top 10 cryptocurrencies into a CSV file which could then be read into Jupyter Notebooks where I reformatted the data for future analysis. Utilized CoinMarketCap's API for the data and various Python libraries such as: pandas, seaborn, os, time, json, requests.exceptions, and requests.

Note: I decided to append data into a CSV file rather than a pandas dataframe because I wanted the data to be an accumulation of multiple days.
